### Applied Project ###

#### Undergraduate Period ####

**1. Image Recommendation System**

- Performed image recommendation based on images' *SIFT-saliency* and user browsing history.

- [Project Homepage](/2015/07/08/Saliency-SIFT-image-recommendation).
<br>

**2. Lane Detection and Inverse Perspective Mapping Generation** 

- Designed and implemented an innovative algorithm to perform automatic *Inverse Perspective Mapping* of road, which tradditionally required camera to be calibrated maunally in advance.

- Performed lane detection based on inverse perspective mapping images.
